        <h2>Why K218b is Unique</h2>
        <p>K218b, also known as K2-18b, is an exoplanet located about 124 light-years away in the constellation Leo. It has garnered significant attention from astronomers and scientists for several reasons:</p>
        
        <h2>1. Potential for Habitability</h2>
        <p>K218b is situated in the habitable zone of its star, which means it is at the right distance to potentially support liquid water on its surface. This makes it a prime candidate for the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Atmosphere Detection</h2>
        <p>In 2019, scientists detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of K218b. This discovery is crucial as it suggests that the planet may have conditions suitable for life.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Size and Composition</h2>
        <p>K218b is classified as a super-Earth, meaning it is larger than Earth but smaller than gas giants like Neptune. Its size and composition could provide insights into the formation of planets and the potential for diverse environments.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Ongoing Research</h2>
        <p>Ongoing studies and observations of K218b using advanced telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope aim to gather more data about its atmosphere and surface conditions, furthering our understanding of this intriguing exoplanet.</p>
