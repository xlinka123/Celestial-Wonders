    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sirius B is a white dwarf star and a companion to Sirius A, the brightest star in the night sky. Located approximately 8.6 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Canis Major, Sirius B was the first white dwarf to be discovered.</p>

    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p>Sirius B was discovered in 1862 by the astronomer Alvan Clark. Its discovery was significant as it provided the first evidence of a white dwarf, a stage in stellar evolution that occurs after a star has exhausted its nuclear fuel.</p>

    <h2>Characteristics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type:</strong> White dwarf</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> Approximately 0.98 solar masses</li>
        <li><strong>Radius:</strong> About 0.0084 solar radii</li>
        <li><strong>Surface Temperature:</strong> Approximately 25,000 K</li>
        <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> About 50.1 years (in relation to Sirius A)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Significance</h2>
    <p>Sirius B has played a crucial role in the study of stellar evolution and the properties of white dwarfs. Its mass and temperature have provided valuable insights into the life cycles of stars and the processes that lead to the formation of white dwarfs.</p>
